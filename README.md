# LFC Reddit Viewer

**All the LFC content. None of the noise.**

## Why?

Because the Reddit mobile site is terrible. Targeted ads between every third post. Popups begging you to use the app. Login walls. Algorithmic nonsense burying the content you actually want to see.

This app pulls posts and comments directly from r/LiverpoolFC and r/liverpoolfcmedia and displays them in a clean, distraction-free interface. No account needed. No ads. Just LFC content.

## What you get

- **Filter by what matters** - Match days, transfers, images, videos, discussions
- **Actually readable comments** - Threaded, collapsible, with inline media
- **Three kit themes** - Anfield Red, Away Cream, Keeper Green
- **Spicy meter** - See which posts are heating up
- **Search across everything** - Find that post you half-remember
- **Sort your way** - Hot, new, top, or viral (score-based ranking)

No login. No tracking. No algorithmic feed manipulation. Just r/LiverpoolFC the way it should be.
