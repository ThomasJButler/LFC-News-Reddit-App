# 🎂 TODO: LFC Reddit App - Next Steps
*Happy Birthday mate! Time to make this app legendary! YNWA! 🔴*

## 🚨 Current Status
- ✅ Desktop version works perfectly
- ❌ Mobile browsers blocked by CORS (all proxies failing)
- 🎯 Need to either fix mobile web OR build native app

---

## 📱 Option A: Fix Mobile Web (Research First)
*Try this first - might find a solution*

### 1. Research Phase (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Use cors-research-prompt.md with Perplexity Deep Research
- [ ] Check if any new CORS proxies launched in 2024
- [ ] Research Cloudflare Workers free tier for custom proxy
- [ ] Check if Vercel Edge Functions could help

### 2. Quick Fixes to Try (1 hour each)
- [ ] Test `https://api.codetabs.com/v1/proxy/?quest=` properly
- [ ] Try spoofing desktop user agent on mobile
- [ ] Test with Reddit's RSS feeds instead of JSON
- [ ] Check if old.reddit.com has different CORS behavior

### 3. Self-Hosted Proxy (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create simple Vercel serverless function as proxy
- [ ] OR use Cloudflare Worker (free tier = 100k requests/day)
- [ ] OR cheap VPS with Node.js proxy ($5/month)

---

## 📲 Option B: Build iOS/Android App (RECOMMENDED)
*This WILL work - no CORS bullshit!*

### Week 1: Setup & Core
- [ ] Install Expo: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- [ ] Create app: `expo init LFCRedditNative`
- [ ] Copy over:
  - [ ] API logic (remove ALL proxy code!)
  - [ ] Redux store
  - [ ] Data processing functions
- [ ] Test basic Reddit fetch (IT WILL JUST WORK! 🎉)

### Week 2: Build Features
- [ ] Convert components to React Native:
  - [ ] PostList → FlatList
  - [ ] PostItem → TouchableOpacity + View
  - [ ] Comments → Nested FlatList
  - [ ] SpicyMeter → Same logic, RN styling
- [ ] Add React Navigation for routing
- [ ] Style with StyleSheet (convert CSS)

### Week 3: Polish & Deploy
- [ ] Add pull-to-refresh
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Cache data with AsyncStorage
- [ ] Test on real iPhone/Android
- [ ] Sign up for Apple Developer ($99/year)
- [ ] Deploy to TestFlight
- [ ] Submit to App Store! 🚀

---

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Do These First!)
*Easy improvements while deciding on mobile solution*

### Today/Tomorrow (Birthday Treats 🎂)
- [ ] Add "Mobile not supported yet" banner with explanation
- [ ] Add "Get notified when mobile app launches" email signup
- [ ] Create GitHub issue asking for mobile testers

### This Week
- [ ] Add README with mobile limitations explained
- [ ] Start Twitter/X account: @LFCRedditApp
- [ ] Post in r/LiverpoolFC about the desktop version
- [ ] Ask for feedback and mobile beta testers

---

## 💡 Smart Move: Progressive Approach

- [ ] Get users and feedback
- [ ] Build community around it

### Phase 2: Mobile Web Workaround (This Week)
- [ ] Try the research findings
