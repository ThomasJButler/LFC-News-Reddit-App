# Reddit Post for r/LiverpoolFC

## Title
**Made a simple LFC-focused Reddit viewer for fellow Reds who just want the footy content**

## Post Content

Alright lads, bit of a weird one but thought some of you might find this useful. 

I got a bit fed up with having to scroll through all the random stuff on Reddit when I really just wanted to see what was happening with Liverpool. So I built this little web app that pulls only LFC-related posts from the main Liverpool subreddits - basically gives you a clean, focused feed without all the distractions.

It's nothing fancy, just does what it says on the tin. Shows posts, comments, images, videos (with sound), and I've added this little "spicy meter" thing that shows how viral posts are getting with chili peppers (seemed fitting for our fiery fanbase!). You can sort by hot, new, top posts, or by how "spicy" they are based on upvotes.

The best part is you can bookmark it on your phone and it works like a proper app - no need to download anything or deal with the official Reddit app if you're just here for Liverpool content. It's completely free, doesn't collect any data, and I'm not making money off it - just thought it might be handy for other supporters.

Still working on it and would appreciate any feedback if you give it a go. What features would actually be useful for following LFC discussions?
